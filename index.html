    <h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    I entered the coding world in February 2023, this is when I was first aquainted with computer coding. I studied at tafe for 6 months and then continued my studies with academy xi.
    I have and still do put a lot of energy into my own progression and development, I find that this is key for succession.<br>

        <h2>Walking through a door into another world</h2>
<p>
I put a lot of thought into what I wanted before deciding on what to study, coding wasn't the first thing that came to me but after long deliberation and thought I had decided I wanted a career that would allow my ideas and imagination to flow. I was finally set on web development.<br>
The only thing I was missing was the ability and skills to create these ideas. Very fast I became fully immersed into the coding world.<br> 
My ideas began to explode and run wild, the realisation that I could finally allow my imagination to flow into something worthwhile.<br> 
I had found my new freedom into another world.<br>
I have a good sense of what I want, and I finally know what trajectory I am heading in. I no longer feel like I'm lost in the clouds trying to figure out what path I should take. <br>
This journey is a continuous learning experience. It seems that the more I learn and understand, the more I realise just what possibilities and opportunities are waiting for me.<br>
The dedication and hours spent learning these new languages are definatly an investment in my future. The skills are invaluable, going through this door opens a lot more than I could have ever imagined.
