        <h2>Walking through a door into another world</h2>
<p>I entered the coding world in February 2023, whilst sitting and pondering my future, what would it look like? How could I move forward if I was stuck in a cloud of my own thoughts and imagination?<br>
I began to write all my ideas and aspirations down, hoping for some inspiration or direction. Coding wasn't the first thing that came to me but after long deliberation and thought I had decided I wanted a career that would allow my ideas and imagination to flow. I was finally set on coding.<br>
the only thing I was missing was the ability and skills to create these ideas. This dilemma had finally given me enough motivation to become fully immersed into the coding world.<br> 
Once I had made this decision, my ideas began to explode and run wild, the realisation that I could finally allow my imagination to flow into something worthwhile.<br> 
I had found my new freedom into another world.<br>
I have a good sense of what I want, and I finally know what trajectory I am heading in. I no longer feel like I'm lost in the clouds with nothing to aim for, wandering with my eyes closed. <br>
I am continuously putting energies into my own development, especially into the coding world.<br>
This journey is a continuous learning experience. It seems that the more I learn and understand, the more I realise just what possibilities and opportunities are waiting for me.<br>
The dedication and hours spent learning these new languages are definatly an investment in my future. The skills are invaluable, going through this door opens a lot more than I could have ever imagined.
