    <h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    My main hobbies include bouldering, bushwalks, and meditation when I'm not coding.<br>
    <br>I entered the coding world in February 2023. This is when I was first acquainted with computer coding. <br>
    I studied at TAFE for 6 months and then continued my studies with Academy Xi. I have, and still do, put a lot of energy into my own progression and development. I find that this is key to success.

        <h2>Walking through a door into another world</h2>
<p>
    I put a lot of thought into what I wanted before deciding on what to study. Initially, coding wasn't my first choice, but after much deliberation and consideration, I realised that I wanted a career that would allow my ideas and imagination to flow. Eventually, I settled on web development.<br>
    The only thing I was missing was the ability and skills to create these ideas. Very fast, I became fully immersed in the coding world.<br>
    My ideas began to develop into more than just imagination, I could allow my imagination to flow into something productive and worthwhile.
    I had found my new freedom into another world. <br>
    <br>I have a good sense of what I want, and I now know the trajectory I am heading in.
    This journey is a continuous learning experience. It seems that the more I learn and understand, the more I realise what possibilities and opportunities are available.<br>
    The skills I'm acquiring are invaluable, and walking through this door has opened up a lot more than I could have anticipated.
